# SCAP - Security Content Automation Protocol
>SCAP is a U.S. standard maintained by NIST. There are a number of tools that provide automated compliance and vulnerability scanning. NIST maintains a list of SCAP-validated scanning tools on their website (https://csrc.nist.gov). 
>
>Specifications include:
>- Resources for asset identification
>- Asset reporting
>- NISTâ€™s Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) and
>- Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
>- Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)
>- Software Identification (SWID)
>- and more
>  
>The idea is to provide content for configuration compliance checks and vulnerability identification that multiple tools can use in order to perform additional evaluation of security based on standards. This is most commonly referenced in environments requiring compliance according to U.S. government specifications.
>
>OpenSCAP (https://www.open-scap.org) is an opensource project that provides a wide variety of configuration baselines and hardening guidance for Linux-based operating systems.
