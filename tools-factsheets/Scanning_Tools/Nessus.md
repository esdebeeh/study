# Nessus - Vulnerability Scanner
> A vulnerability scanner that performs network discovery using port scans and enumerate services from either an authenticated or nonauthenticated context. 
> 
> From an unauthenticated context, it attempts to connect to exposed services and use banner and installation information or differences in protocol responses to attempt to identify listening services and versions.
> 
> It can then compare that information to an extensive internal database of known vulnerabilities to highlight potential or confirmed vulnerabilities on the identified services. This is useful for identifying potential paths for exploitation and quickly performing mass discovery when stealth is not a concern during a pentest.
